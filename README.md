This is my private git repository.
The implemented design patterns in this project are:
1)Facade
2)Bridge
3)Factory
The process in which the program flow goes is :
step 1:
The program reads the input files in which the credentials of buyers and sellers are given and 
next it validates the password according the input from the user.(1 for buyer and 2 for seller)
It displays whether the authentication is success or fail. In this facade design pattern is implemented.
step 2 :
After the authentication it asks for the menu option whether it is meat produce menu or product produce menu. (1 for meat menu and 2 for product menu)
It displays menu according to that.
In this bridge design pattern is implemented.
step 3 :
In this step persons product information along with buyers and sellers menu is displayed by calling necessary functions.
In this factory design pattern is implemented.
